Paster Template
===============

Many of these are probably just HOWTO documents!


Error documents (404 and 5xx)
-----------------------------

Displaying nice error documents is something most HTML applications need/want
to do so it should be made as easy as possible.


Optional Templating Support
---------------------------

Setting up templating is boring. Let's provide HOWTOs or contrib code to help
the user get going with templating. Basically, that means adding a 'templates'
directory under the main package (a good default location) and setting up the
renderer in the project's wsgiapp module.


Optional Session Support
------------------------

Should we actually encourage this? No, let's just make a HOWTO for it.


Optional Caching Support
------------------------

Caching can be useful but restish should tackle http caching first. Let's write
a HOWTO for application caching.


Optional Authentication Support
-------------------------------

AuthKit ... repoze.who ... custom. Let's write a HOWTO.


Optional Database Support
-------------------------

Lots of web apps use a database so let's make it easy. Start with a HOWTO and
see if proper support really needs adding later.
